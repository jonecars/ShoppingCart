# Overview
This is a shopping cart program.  It takes input from the user and displays it in a list.  The user can then delete items, add items, and display total price of the cart. 
The program interacts with the user through the console. 
This is my first program in C#.  Because of this, I wrote this software to learn the basics of the language.

# Development Environment
I used visual studio code with the microsoft c# extension to write this program.  
C# 7.3 was used to write this program.

# Future Work
* Read/Write from an outside file.
* Should be able to save progress even when the program is quit.
* I would like to add an interface to the program.

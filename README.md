# Overview

{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C# language.}
This is a shopping cart program.  It takes input from the user and displays it in a list.  The user can then delete items, add items, and display total price of the cart. 
The program interacts with the user through the console.

This is my first program in C3.  Because of this, I wrote this software to learn the basics of C#.
